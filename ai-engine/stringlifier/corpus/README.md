# Standard training data

The training data was generated by running `scripts/01-generate-synthetic-training-data.py` and `scripts/02-split-generated-data.py` on a list of common english words, available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt).

# Generating your own training data

If you want to generate your own dataset, you simply need to create a training and a validation file. They follow a simple format:

```text
<CHARACTER SEQUENCE><TAB><TYPE><TAB><SUBTYPE>
```

**Example**

```text
ngnix	STRING	PROGRAM
Y29tbWl4dHVyZQ==	HASH	PASSWORD
b3d2cf2ec3894374b37d1b79edd57ad4	HASH	API_KEY
9c795829-75bc-4596-87d3-3508372bbf5f	HASH	API_KEY
licenser	STRING	WORD
```

**NOTE:** There are no predefined values for `type` and `subtype`.
